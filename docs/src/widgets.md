# Widgets

## What is a widget?

A widget is simply some graphical component that we can generate from Julia and that has an output.
The output of a widget is a [`Observable`](@ref) and can be accessed with `observe`.

A `Widget` itself behaves pretty much like a [`Observable`](@ref) and the techniques discussed in [Observables](@ref) apply. For example:

```@repl manual
using Interact
s = slider(1:100);
s[]
Interact.@on print(string("The value is ", &s))
s[] = 12;
```

## Text input

These are widgets to select text input that's typed in by the user. For numbers use [`spinbox`](@ref) and for strings use [`textbox`](@ref). String entries ([`textbox`](@ref) and [`autocomplete`](@ref)) are initialized as `""`, whereas [`spinbox`](@ref) defaults to `nothing`, which corresponds to the empty entry.

```@docs
spinbox
textbox
textarea
autocomplete
```

## Type input

These are widgets to select a specific, non-text, type of input. So far, `Date`, `Time`, `Color` and `Bool` are supported. Types that allow a empty field (`Date` and `Time`) are initialized as `nothing` by default, whereas `Color` and `Bool` are initialized with the default HTML value (`colorant"black"` and `false` respectively).

timepicker
colorpicker
checkbox
toggle
```

## File input

```@docs
filepicker
opendialog
savedialog
```

## Range input

```@docs
slider
rangeslider
rangepicker
```

## Callback input

```@docs
button
```
## HTML5 input

All of the inputs above are implemented wrapping the `input` tag of HTML5 which can be accessed more directly as follows:

```@docs
Interact.input
```

## Option input

```@docs
dropdown
radiobuttons
checkboxes
toggles
togglebuttons
tabs
```

## Output

```@docs
latex
alert
highlight
notifications
togglecontent
tabulator
mask
```

## Create widgets automatically from a Julia variable
